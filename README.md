Pandamonium
===========

This is yet another implementation of networking for Panda3D, taking heavy
inspiration from OTP, the CMU server, and Astron. It is _not_ a drop-in
replacement for any of those.

The current state is early pre-alpha, "Let's throw some code together and see
what becomes of it."
